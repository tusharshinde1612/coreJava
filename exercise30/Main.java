//Exercise 28 : A boy has his money deposited $1000, $1500 and $2000 in banks-Bank A, Bank B 
//and Bank C respectively. We have to print the money deposited by him in a particular bank. 
//Create a class 'Bank' with a method 'getBalance' which returns 0. Make its three subclasses 
//named 'BankA', 'BankB' and 'BankC' with a method with the same name 'getBalance' which returns 
//the amount deposited in that particular bank. Call the method 'getBalance' by the object of each of the three banks.
